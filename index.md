## Hi, it's MUMU

This app will calculate the size of the grid needed, which will guide you to maintain the correct drawing proportion. It will draw a layer of a grid on top of an image (overlay of the image) and suggest to you the amount and size of its cells, depends on your image size. Now artists can skip the painful part of calculating the appropriate grid size.

### We have two ways of creating a modular grid:

1. Using AR: Choose an illustration/photo and put it in your wall using Augmented Reality, and scale it as you want. Then, see if you can have your calculated grid options in small, medium, and large size of grid cells.
2. Using Manual Input: Choose an illustration/photo, input its width or height as you desire. Then, see if you can have your calculated grid options in small, medium, and large size of grid cells.
